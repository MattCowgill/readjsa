{readjsa} streamlines the process of getting data from [Jobs and Skills Australia](https://www.jobsandskills.gov.au) into R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of readjsa from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MattCowgill/readjsa")
```

## Getting REOS data

It's straightforward to get data from the Recruitment Experience & Outlook Survey (REOS):

```{r reos-example}
library(readjsa)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

reos <- read_reos(tables = "all")

reos |> 
  filter(series == "Recruitment rate",
         frequency == "Monthly") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, col = disaggregation)) +
  geom_line()
```
